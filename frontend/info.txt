.env files

.env files (environment or env is a file that holds variables and some sensitive data about your app)
Why we need env files in our app?

Note: In React, components are loaded into a single HTML file. So it is really important not to bloat the 
      main Js file. We can put each React component into a separate file, to make our application files 
      more readable.
      Further, use React Hooks for reusability. 
      The main js file should be clean with components mounting provided the situation.

        //Runs only on the first render

        //Runs on the first render
        //Runs at any time the dependency value changes
